BreakAll
========

This project started as an assignment for the CG course I took while undergrad
at my university (UFMG). It was an implementation of a Breakout game, using
OpenGL. The final version produced for the course is tagged v0.1.

Currently, I'm rewriting the game, incorporating many cool ideas which I either
saw on other implementations during the CG class or thought myself but didn't
have time to implement. 

I'm also take the opportunity and using it as a sandbox where I can test things
and learn more about modern OpenGL programming, so don't expect it to be stable,
or even playable soon.

Dependencies
